                  Gliomas are tumors originating in glial cells that support and
                  nourish nerve cells in the brain. They are the most common
                  type of primary brain tumors and can occur in different parts
                  of the brain. Gliomas are classified into different grades
                  based on their aggressiveness and how quickly they are likely
                  to grow. The grades range from low-grade (slow-growing) to
                  high-grade (fast-growing) tumors. Common symptoms of gliomas
                  include headaches, seizures, cognitive changes, and
                  neurological deficits. Treatment options for gliomas may
                  include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy,
                  depending on the tumor's location, grade, and the overall
                  health of the patient. The prognosis for gliomas varies
                  depending on several factors, including the tumor grade, size,
                  location, and the patient's age and overall health.{" "}

                  Pituitary tumors are growths that develop in the pituitary
                  gland. These tumors can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous
                  (malignant). Pituitary tumors can disrupt the normal
                  functioning of the pituitary gland, which is responsible for
                  producing and regulating various hormones in the body. As a
                  result, they can cause hormonal imbalances and lead to a range
                  of symptoms, such as headaches, vision problems, hormonal
                  changes, fatigue, and infertility. Treatment options for
                  pituitary tumors include medication, surgery, and radiation
                  therapy, depending on the size, type, and location of the
                  tumor. The prognosis for pituitary tumors varies depending on
                  several factors, including tumor size, type, and the
                  individual's overall health.
